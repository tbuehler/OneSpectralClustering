# 1-Spectral clustering

This package contains a Matlab implementation of *1-Spectral Clustering*.
Given a graph with weight matrix W, the *inverse power method (IPM)* for 
nonlinear eigenproblems is used to compute a non-constant eigenvector 
of the graph 1-Laplacian, which then yields a bipartition of the graph. 
A multipartitioning is then obtained using a recursive splitting scheme.




## Installation

The implementation uses a mex-file to solve the inner problem of the
IPM. Compile it using 

    mex -largeArrayDims solveInnerProblem.cpp 

in the matlab command line.



## Usage

    [clusters,cuts,cheegers] = OneSpectralClustering(W,crit,k,numRuns,verbosity);

#### Input 
    
    W            Sparse weight matrix. Has to be symmetric.
    crit         The multipartition criterion to be optimized.
                 Available choices are
                        'ncut' - Normalized Cut, 
                        'ncc'  - Normalized Cheeger Cut,
                        'rcut' - Ratio Cut, 
                        'rcc'  - Ratio Cheeger Cut
    k            number of clusters


#### Input (optional)

    numRuns     - number of additional times the multipartitioning scheme
                  is performed with random initializations (default is 10). 
    verbosity   - Controls how much information is displayed. 
                  Levels 0 (silent) - 4 (very verbose), default is 2.


#### Output
    
    clusters    mx(k-1) matrix containing in each column the computed
                clustering for each partitioning step.
    cuts        (k-1)x1 vector containing the Ratio/Normalized Cut values after 
                each partitioning step.
    cheegers    (k-1)x1 vector containing the Ratio/Normalized Cheeger Cut 
                values after each partitioning step.

The final clustering is obtained via clusters(:,end), the corresponding 
cut/Cheeger cut values via cuts(end), cheegers(end).
